    and everything in between. It scales down to small installations and up to massive ones, and is
    designed to be easy to install and maintain.

    Connect your Open edX instance to external services with this handy plugin by adding webhooks and webfilters.
    Both webhooks and webfilters are triggered when certain events happen in your platform,
    e.g. when a student logs in, when a certificate is issued, and many more. Then they will
    send an http request to a configurable URL with all the relevant information. Web filters also
    allow you to interrupt the process, modify certain data or perform specific actions.
