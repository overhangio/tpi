# TODO there are too few plugins here. We should reach out to contrib maintainers to add plugins that were previously compatible with redwood/sumac.

    Aspects is an analytics system for delivering actionable data about course and learner performance.
    It uses open source tools and public standards to deliver rich dashboards embedded directly in the
    Learning Management System, while also providing a full powered reporting package for deeper
    dives into the data, emailed reports, and alerts supported by Apache Superset.

    Aspects is customizable from end-to-end, allowing you to add new data sources, new dashboards,
    and everything in between. It scales down to small installations and up to massive ones, and is
    designed to be easy to install and maintain.
